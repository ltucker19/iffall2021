                    <li><img class="rufusandcarlatomalbumpage" src="images/rufusandcarlatom.jpeg"> </li>
                    <p> Rufus and Carla was the moniker Stax Records used when releasing duets by Rufus Thomas and daughter Carla Thomas. They have the distinction of sharing the company's first hit "Cause I Love You" when Stax was briefly known as Satellite Records.[1] Another hit was their version of "The Night Time Is the Right Time".

                    <li><img class="bookertandthemgsalbumpage" src="images/bookertandthemgs.jpeg"></li>
                    <p> In 1970, the quartet applied their oft-imitated signature sound to some surprising source material: the Beatles’ Abbey Road. Abbey Road is a lot of things – trippy, bold, lush, joyous – but one thing it isn’t is funky. You’d never know that listening to McLemore Avenue, though. The band turns the songs on their head, wringing out fiery grooves from every note.
