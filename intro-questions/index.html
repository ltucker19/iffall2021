                <li> Hi my name is Lea Tucker. I am a Junior majoring in communication design.</li>
                <li> I an required to take this class for my major, but I took a website design class in highschool and I really enjoyed it.</li>
                <li> I took a semester long class in HTML and CSS and I also took AP computer science for one semester. </li>
                <li> I hope to learn about HTML and improve my website design skills.</li>
                <li> Designing for screen is a lot different than designing for paper as it is a lot easier to fix mistakes online but online is a lot more complex.</li>
                <li> This is a website that exemplifies effective design, it is clear which school the student attends and all of the classes are sorted into clear sections.
